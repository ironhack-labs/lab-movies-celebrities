**FROM Nick Born SLACK MESSAGES**
1. add signup and login to your movies celebrities app　✅
2. add a like button to the movies details page　✅　
3. add a user profile page　✅
4. on the user profile page we should be able to see all the movies the user liked and have a link to each of them　✅


5. give your user the ability to change their password -----> see github Animals for this. (make a change passwords page also)✅　**SHOULD HAVE TO BE LOGGED IN TO DO THIS**
6. make it so the user must be logged in in order to create new movies or celebrities (or to like movies) **--middleware!!! will fix this.**
7. edit the movie details page so that it shows how many users have liked that movie (edited) 


8. add error and success messages when signing up and logging in and when the user successfully likes a movie --- **can do this using the lesson- but also want to try doing it his way.**
9. add a forgot-password link on the login page, when the user clicks on the link, they go to a page that asks them to type in their email into an input box, then the app gives them a new (random) password and sends them an email with their new password (the email should advise the user to go and change their password to a more permanent one once they log in) (edited)
