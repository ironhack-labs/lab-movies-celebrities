{{!-- Steps we will follow in this iteration:
In the routes file (routes/celebrities.routes.js) create the following GET route: /celebrities/create
In that route we have to render the celebrities/new-celebrity view
In that view file:
Add an <h2> for the page's heading.
Add a <form> tag that makes a POST request to /celebrities/create.
Add <input> tags inside the form so the user can fill in values for each attribute of the celebrity. Make an input for name, occupation, and catchPhrase
Add a <button> tag in the form so the user can submit the form once they are done filling it out.
Create the /celebrities/create POST route in routes/celebrities.routes.js.
In that route we have to create an instance of the Celebrity model (don't forget, we should get all the info from the form through req.body)
If there is an error, render the celebrities/new-celebrity view so the user can try again and
If there is no error, redirect to the page with the list of celebrities. This route will be created in the next iteration /celebrities
In the views/index.hbs view file:
Add a link that goes to the page you just created with the form to create a new celebrity. --}}
